Speech Enhancement/Separation
-----------------------------

* ### GAN-based speech enhancement for CI users
An important question in developing DNN-based speech enhancement systems for CI users is, what optimization criterion should be used to train the networks? Mean square error (MSE) or log-MSE measures are normally used, but research in CI domain has shown that these measures do not correlate well with the speech intelligibility of CI users. Conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) provides a solution by replacing the optimization loss functions with a discriminator network. In this project, I am exploring different methods of leveraging CGAN-based architectures to improve the speech intelligibility of CI users.
